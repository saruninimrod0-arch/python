# Loops -> Sometimes we may need to do a piece of works a number of repeated times in such cases we may use loops.
# A loop is a control structure that allows us to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
# There are two types of loops in python i.e: The for loop and the while loop

# Below is the syntax of a for loop in python:
"""

for variable in range(n):
    # block of code to be executed
