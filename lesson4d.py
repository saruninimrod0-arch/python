# Python while loop.
#  While loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. The syntax of a while loop in python is as follows:
"""
initilization of a variable,
while keyword,
followed by the condition/statement to be evaluated,
followed by a full colon(:),
code to be printed out,
increment/decrement
"""

number = 0
while number < 5:
 print("Hello Moses", number)
 number =number + 1

print("===================================")
# Create a python program that prints the even numbers from 50 to 70 using while loop

number = 50

while number <= 70:
 print(number)
 number = number + 2


print("===================================")
# below is a decrement example that prints the multiples of 3 starting from 201 to 150
number = 201
while number >= 150:
 print(number)
 number = number - 3
